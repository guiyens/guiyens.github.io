        ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠈⠙⠛⠿⠿⠿⠇⠀⠉⠁⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀         you can download my CV in PDF format from the project explorer sidebar (on the left side).


        The concept of this website is to showcase my skills, expertise, and what I do on a typical workday (such as writing, testing, 
        and reviewing code), all within a structure similar to a typical web front-end project in an IDE. 
        However, I didn’t want to use a real instance of VSC (in this case). Instead, I created a clone of VSC with the basic 
        functionality to suit my purpose.

        === ABOUT THE VSC CLONE ===

        What I tried to clone from the original VSC is the following: 
        - The main UI interface 
        - Functionality: 
            + Open and close files: Open from files explorer in the left sidebar clicking on the file name. Close from the x icon the top tabs. 
            + Active files from top tabs: Clicking on the top tabs 
            + Open and close the Explorer sidebar: Clicking on the first icon in the icons bar. 
            + Show different code languages: Just opening different files you can see code in different languages. 
            + Change the code editor theme: You can choose theme clicking in the Wheel icon in the bottom left corner, and selecting the theme.
        
          === ABOUT THE 'FAKE' PROJECT ===

        As I mentioned, the idea is to showcase my skills, expertise... within the typical web front-end project structure in an IDE. 
        But that's it. This is not compilable code; it's close, but not quite there.

        For my purpose, I defined a class with my name at the root of the project (GuillermoRamosVega.ts), 
        which could serve as the entry point for the project.
        In this class, you’ll find key information about me. The properties in this class are organized by interfaces, 
        giving you an idea of the roles I’ve had in the past on a development team.
        
        However, to make it more readable, I extracted some static data from this class and placed it in JSON files within the 'data' folder. 
        For instance, if you want to check my work experience, you can open the 'workingExperience.json' file in the data folder.
        Additionally, I tried to reference other typical files found in a front-end project, such as package.json, README.md, 
        .gitignore, .scss, etc.
        
        === ABOUT THE REAL PROJECT ===

        This project is built with the following technologies: 
            - React 19: I use components, hooks, and reactivity from this framework. 
            - TypeScript: I prefer to write code with types, which is why I use TypeScript. 
            - Tailwind 3.4: While it's not my favorite, it provided me with development speed. 
            - react-syntax-highlighter: Used to display code and apply syntax highlighting to code colors."

        I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT!
